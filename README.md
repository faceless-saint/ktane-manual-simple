# KTANE Simplified Bomb Defusal Manual

This is a refined version of the original bomb defusal manual for the game "Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes",
featuring enhanced readability and ease of use. This is not a smart manual or similar form of computer-aided
bomb defusal solution, but instead is merely a more streamlined version of the original document.

It is recommended to replace the corresponding pages of the original manual with their simplified counterparts.
